# Applied Statistical Inference Coursework

This repository contains the code for my coursework on Applied Statistical Inference, where I work with probability distributions, maximum likelihood estimation, and statistical modeling. 

I applied advanced statistical techniques to estimate parameters and assess model fit using a parametric family of probability density functions. Key tasks included performing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with optimization methods (BFGS), conducting sensitivity analysis, calculating 95% confidence intervals using the delta method, and testing hypotheses with the generalized likelihood ratio test. I also compared model performance using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). This project demonstrated my skills in statistical modeling and R programming.
